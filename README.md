# dashboard-interface
I built this dashboard from an Odin Project exercise (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) with HTML and CSS. 

This is an older exercise but I like that it makes you figure out ways to build this kind of layout with Grid! 

I plan to build a similar project but with the newer features that have recently been added to Grid.
